#!/bin/bash
#
# This script extracts the contents of a zip archive in a user-friendly way, 
# whether the archive has a single root file/directory or multiple files at the 
# root level.
#   * If the archive contains just one root file or directory, the script 
#     extracts it directly.
#   * If the archive contains multiple files at the root level, the script 
#     creates a subdirectory named after the archive and extracts all files into
#     this subdirectory.
# 
# Benefits:
# * No need to manually check the archiveâ€™s structure.
# * Avoids double nested directories.
# * Prevents accidental extraction of multiple files into the current directory.
#
# Implementation:
# The script extracts the archive into a temporary directory at first. Then it
# checks if there's a single root element or multiple root elements. If there's
# a single root element, it copies that root element to the current directory.
# If there are multiple root elements, it moves the whole temporary directory to
# the current directory.
